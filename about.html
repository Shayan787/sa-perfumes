      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        SA Perfumes was founded with a passion for capturing emotions through fragrance. 
        Inspired by elegance, culture, and nature, we create perfumes that do more than smell good — they tell a story.
      </p>
      <p>
        From humble beginnings in a small studio, we’ve grown into a brand trusted by thousands. 
        Each bottle is crafted with precision, care, and a love for the art of perfumery.
